# Flutter UX Solutions

UX is somewha a subject where the FORM EXERCISES have to be completed in the medium you are working in. And that is certainly the case with the Dart computer language and the FLutter framework.

I have borrowed from others such as GSkinner in code examples as they provided a good base. While at the same time they did not do enough UX polish using changes within the flutter SDK itself.

Each example is basically a one screen app with enough data and user interaction to show UX solutions using some flutter UX techniques.
